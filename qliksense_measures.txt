Project: Genesys Analytics ETL



1. CONTEXT


This Qlik Sense dashboard is built on top of a near real-time ETL pipeline
ingesting Genesys Cloud data.

The dashboard is intentionally simple.
The main value of the project lies in the ingestion strategy,
data modeling, and transformation logic.

Operational and customer-related data is partially hidden
to respect GDPR and data privacy constraints.



2. DATA ASSUMPTIONS


Fact table: fact_calls
Bridge table: fact_call_skills

Key fields:
Interaction_Id
conversation_start_ts
conversation_end_ts
call_duration_ms
call_answered_flag
User_Id
Queue_Id
Division_Id
Skill_Id
WrapUpCode_Id

Calendar linked via CalendarDate



3. GLOBAL FILTERS (USED ACROSS DASHBOARD)


CalendarDate
Year
Month
Week
Date
Hour

User_Name
Queue_Name
Division_Name
Skill_Name
WrapUp_Label

call_answered_flag (Answered / Abandoned)



4. TIME AND DURATION HANDLING


Genesys APIs often return durations in milliseconds.

Durations are stored as numeric values in the warehouse.
Formatting to hh:mm:ss is handled in Qlik.

Conversion rules:
- ms to seconds: /1000
- ms to Qlik time value: /(1000*60*60*24)

Preferred display method:
Interval(duration_ms / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss')



5. CORE KPI MEASURES


Total Calls
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Answered Calls
Count({<call_answered_flag{1}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Abandoned Calls
Count({<call_answered_flag{0}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Answer Rate
Count({<call_answered_flag{1}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)
/
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)



6. DURATION METRICS


Average Call Duration (hh:mm:ss)
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )

Max Call Duration (hh:mm:ss)
Interval( Max(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )

Average Call Duration (seconds)
Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000



7. TIME-BASED ANALYSIS


Calls by Day
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Calls by Hour
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Duration by Hour
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



8. AGENT PERFORMANCE


Calls per Agent
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Answered Calls per Agent
Count({<call_answered_flag{1}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Agent Answer Rate
Count({<call_answered_flag{1}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)
/
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Handling Time per Agent
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



9. QUEUE PERFORMANCE


Calls per Queue
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Queue Answer Rate
Count({<call_answered_flag{1}>} DISTINCT Interaction_Id)
/
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Duration per Queue
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



10. DIVISION ANALYSIS


Calls per Division
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Duration per Division
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



11. SKILL ANALYSIS


Calls per Skill
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Duration per Skill
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



12. WRAP-UP / QUALIFICATION ANALYSIS


Calls per Wrap-up Code
Count(DISTINCT Interaction_Id)

Average Duration per Wrap-up Code
Interval( Avg(call_duration_ms) / 1000, 'hh:mm:ss' )



13. DATA QUALITY / SANITY CHECKS


Incomplete Records
Sum(incomplete_record_flag)

Valid Duration Rate
Sum(valid_duration_flag) / Count(Interaction_Id)



14. DASHBOARD STRUCTURE (LOGICAL)


Top section:
- Total Calls
- Answer Rate
- Average Call Duration

Middle section:
- Calls by Day
- Calls by Hour
- Answer Rate by Queue

Bottom section:
- Agent Performance
- Skill Distribution
- Wrap-up Analysis

All charts respond to global filters.



15. INTERVIEW ONE-LINER


“Durations are stored in milliseconds in the warehouse
and converted to hh:mm:ss at the BI layer to keep the model numeric and flexible.”
